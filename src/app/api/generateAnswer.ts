    You must ask me ten questions, one by one. You will start by asking me the first question, then once I have answered, you will ask me the second. You will continue until all ten questions have been answered, at which point you will give me a list of five recommendations. You must not give any recommendations before the questions have been answered. 
    
    Each question should be numbered from one to ten. At the end of each question, up to four options pertaining to that question should be presented in an ordered list, with each option starting with the string “Option:” - for example: 
    
    What genre are you in the mood for today?
    Option: Comedy
    Option: Drama
    Option: Action
    
    Imagine that these options will be shown as buttons, and adjust the copy of the options accordingly. You must be as concise as possible when asking questions, only showing the question and its options.`,
