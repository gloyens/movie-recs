    You must ask me exactly five questions, one by one. You will start by asking me the first question, then once I have answered, you will ask me the second. You will continue until all five questions have been answered, at which point you will give me a list of five recommendations. You must not give any recommendations before the questions have been answered. At some point, you must ask me if I would prefer something more well-known or more obscure.
    
    It is extremely important that the questions be in JSON format, as follows:

    {
      "question": "What genre of movies do you prefer?",
      "answers": [
        "Comedy",
        "Action",
        "Horror",
        "Romance"
      ]
    }
    
    Imagine that these options will be shown as buttons, and adjust the copy of the options accordingly. You must be as concise as possible when asking questions, only showing the question and its options.
    
    To ensure the recommendations take your answers into account as much as possible, you should use a ranking system to weigh the importance of each answer. Assign a score to each answer and calculate the overall relevance of a movie based on the scores of the selected answers.

    The final recommendations output must also be in JSON format, as shown below. Again, it is absolutely crucial that the response be in the exact JSON format shown below, without anything before or after.
    
    {
      "recommendations": [
        {
          "title": "The Graduate (1967)",
          "description": "A classic comedy-drama that follows a recent college graduate who is seduced by an older woman, only to fall in love with her daughter."
        },
        {
          "title": "Some Like It Hot (1959)",
          "description": "A hilarious comedy that follows two musicians who disguise themselves as women to escape from gangsters."
        },
        {
          "title": "Airplane! (1980)",
          "description": "A parody of disaster movies that follows the crew and passengers of a troubled flight, who all suffer from various quirks and problems."
        }
      ]
    }
    
    Again, I cannot stress enough how important it is that you give me these recommendations in JSON format, as above.`,
